# Clustering Algorithms Project

This project explores the application of three popular clustering algorithms—K-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN—on a synthetic customer dataset. The dataset includes attributes such as age, annual income, and spending score. The performance of each algorithm is analyzed and compared.
